Credit to Alex the Analyst for the data set.

1. Created some more sheets to prepare (Working sheet, Pivot Table, Dashboard)
2. Copied the data onto the working sheet incase I mess something up. I'll have the original data to go back to.
3. Used Remove duplicates
4. Changed M to Married and S to Single so there is less confusion with Gender.
	- But also went ahead and changed M and F to Male and Female respectively.
5. Checked rest of the columns to make sure there was no misspelled words or anything seemed off.
6. Added a new column to create age brackets.

Then moved on to creating Pivot Tables with graphs.
7. Started with Avg Income per purchase
	- Income = Value changed to average
	- Gender = Row
	- Purchase = Column
8. Customer Commute
	- Commute Distance = Row
	- Purchased Bike = Column and Value
	-Had to fix commute distance of 10+ miles since it wasn't showing in order.
